# 🚀 Running the application

This project is divided into three parts:

- **Server** (backend folder)
- **Web** (web folder)
- **Mobile** (mobile folder)

💡 Both Web and Mobile need the Server to be running to work.

</div>

## Pre-requisites

- **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)**

    *Install the LTS version.*

    Required to run JS / TS code on your machine.

- **[Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/pt-BR/docs/install/#windows-stable)**

    Node.js package manager.

    Used to install the libraries and frameworks used in the application.

    *You can also use NPM, which is installed on your computer when you install Node.js*

- **[Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)**

    Contains several resources for versioning the code.

    It can also be used to download the application code on your local machine.

## Downloading

Download the application on your machine with the following command on the terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Eduardo-SO/Ecoleta.git

# or if you have an SSH key configured on github run the command below

git clone git@github.com:Eduardo-SO/Ecoleta.git

- Access it:

  ```bash
  cd Ecoleta
  ```

## Adjustments
Before we continue, make sure to change the application's IP to your local machine's IP

You can change them at:
- `backend\src\controllers\ItemsController.ts`
- `backend\src\controllers\PointsController.ts`
- `mobile\src\services\api.ts`

## Running the server

- Enter the `backend` folder:

  ```bash
  cd backend
  ```

- Install dependencies with Yarn:

  ```bash
  yarn
  ```

- Run the migrations to create the tables in the database:

  ```bash
  yarn knex:migrate
  ```

- Run the seed to populate the items table:

  ```bash
  yarn knex:seed
  ```

- Start the server:

  ```bash
  yarn dev:server
  ```

With that the server will be started on the port `3333`

**Open a new terminal** and continue following the steps below

</div>

## Running the front-end (Web)

- If you are in the `backend` folder, run the following command to enter the `web` folder:

  ```bash
  cd ../web
  ```

- Install dependencies with Yarn:

  ```bash
  yarn
  ```

- Start the web server:

  ```bash
  yarn start
  ```

With that the server will be started in [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)

**Open a new terminal** and continue following the steps below

<div align="right">

- If you are in the `web` folder, run the following command to enter the `mobile` folder:

  ```bash
  cd ../mobile
  ```

- Install dependencies with Yarn:

  ```bash
  yarn
  ```
